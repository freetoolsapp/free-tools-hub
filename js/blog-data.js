        content: `
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why Thumbnails Matter</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Your YouTube thumbnail is the first thing potential viewers see. It's like a book cover - it needs to grab attention and convince people to click. Studies show that custom thumbnails can increase click-through rates by up to 154%!</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Use Bright, Contrasting Colors</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">YouTube's interface is mostly white and gray, so your thumbnail needs to stand out. Use bright colors like red, yellow, or orange. Create contrast by pairing complementary colors together.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Include Faces with Emotions</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Thumbnails with human faces get 38% more clicks. Show clear emotions - surprise, excitement, or curiosity work best. Make sure the face is large enough to see even on mobile devices.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Add Text Overlays (But Keep It Short)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Use 3-5 words maximum. The text should complement your title, not repeat it. Use large, bold fonts that are readable even on small screens.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Follow the Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Divide your thumbnail into a 3x3 grid and place important elements along these lines or at intersection points. This creates a more visually appealing composition.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Maintain Consistency</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Use similar styles, fonts, and colors across your thumbnails to build brand recognition. Viewers should instantly recognize your content.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. Test Different Designs</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Create multiple thumbnail options and see which performs better. YouTube Analytics shows you click-through rates for each video.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Recommended Tools</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">You don't need expensive software to create great thumbnails:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Canva:</strong> Free templates specifically designed for YouTube thumbnails</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Using too much text (keep it under 5 words)</li>

                <li>Using low-resolution images that appear blurry</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Being a student is challenging. Between classes, assignments, exams, and social life, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. The key isn't working harder - it's working smarter. Here are proven productivity hacks that top students use.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. The Pomodoro Technique</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four "pomodoros," take a longer 15-30 minute break. This prevents burnout and maintains focus.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Use Active Recall</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Instead of re-reading notes, test yourself. Close your books and try to recall information from memory. This is proven to be more effective than passive review.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Create a Study Schedule</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Use our free Study Planner tool to organize your time. Block out specific hours for each subject and stick to the schedule. Consistency is key!</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Eliminate Distractions</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Turn off phone notifications, use website blockers during study time, and create a dedicated study space. Even small distractions can break your focus for up to 23 minutes.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Take Smart Notes</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Use the Cornell Note-Taking System: divide your page into sections for notes, key points, and summary. Review and summarize after each lecture.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. Practice Spaced Repetition</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Review material at increasing intervals: after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month. This moves information into long-term memory.</p>

                Time Blocking: Schedule Like a CEO
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Time blocking</strong> is the practice of dividing your day into dedicated blocks for specific tasks. Instead of reacting to whatever comes your way, you proactively control your schedule.</p>

                The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> states that <strong>80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts</strong>. Identify and focus on high-impact tasks.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> If you're a content creator, writing one viral blog post (20% effort) might bring 80% of your traffic, while publishing 10 average posts yields minimal results.</p>

                Eat the Frog First
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>"Eat the frog"</strong> means tackling your most challenging or dreaded task first thing in the morning. Once it's done, everything else feels easier.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Mark Twain famously said, <em>"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning."</em></p>
            <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 my-4 rounded">

                The Pomodoro Technique
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a time management method where you work in focused 25-minute intervals (called "pomodoros") followed by 5-minute breaks.</p>
            <div class="bg-orange-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
                <p class="font-semibold mb-2"><i class="fas fa-stopwatch text-orange-600 mr-2"></i>How It Works:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Choose a task to work on</li>
                    <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li>
                    <li>Work with full focus until the timer rings</li>
                    <li>Take a 5-minute break</li>
                    <li>After 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why it works:</strong> The technique leverages urgency (beating the timer) and prevents burnout through regular breaks.</p>

                Batch Similar Tasks Together
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Task batching</strong> means grouping similar activities and completing them in one dedicated session.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Check and respond to all emails in 2-3 designated time slots instead of constantly checking</li>
                <li>Record all video content for the week in one afternoon</li>
                <li>Make all phone calls back-to-back</li>
                <li>Schedule all meetings on specific days (e.g., Tuesdays and Thursdays)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reduces context switching, which can waste up to <strong>40% of productive time</strong>.</p>

                The 2-Minute Rule
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Popularized by productivity expert David Allen, the <strong>2-minute rule</strong> states: <em>If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.</em></p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Replying to a quick email</li>
